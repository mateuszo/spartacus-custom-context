# Custom Context in [SAP Spartacus](https://github.com/SAP/spartacus)

This repository shows how to set up a custom context parameter and use it in the url.
In the given example we combine language and currency into one parameter but it could be actually anything you want.

In future, adding custom context might be simplified in Spartacus: https://github.com/SAP/spartacus/issues/7368

## How to run

Simply run

$ yarn start
```

```
